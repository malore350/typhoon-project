# Typhoon image analysis using deep learning

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

This repository contains the code and resources for a novel object detection project that aims to identify and locate typhoons in satellite imagery using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) algorithm.

The objective of this project is to provide an automated system that can accurately detect typhoons and predict its path, potentially helping meteorologists, climate scientists, and disaster management teams to track these powerful weather systems more effectively.

In this repository, you will find:

* Preprocessing scripts for converting satellite images into the format required for YOLOv8.
* The YOLOv8 model training and testing scripts.
* Data downloading and preprocessing scripts.
* Instructions for setting up and running the code.

This project combines deep learning and satellite meteorology to create a practical tool for typhoon detection and tracking. While it's currently focused on typhoons, the methods and code could be adapted to other severe weather events, demonstrating the versatility and potential of machine learning in meteorology.

## Getting Started
